# **Tensor Networks Challenge**


This folder contains all the necessary information about the tensor networks challenge. In the [notebooks folder](notebooks) you will find the files that contain the different parts of the challenge. Inside the folder you can find:

- [Tensor networks tutorials](notebooks/Tensor_networks_tutorials.ipynb): notebook containing explanations about basic concepts and examples about tensor networks.

- [Tensor networks exercises](notebooks/Tensor_networks_exercises.ipynb): notebook containing unsolved tensor networks exercises that must be completed before taking the challenge. These exercises provide a smoother entry to solving the challenges.

- [Tensor networks challenge](notebooks/Tensor_networks_challenge.ipynb): notebook containing this year's **two** challenges. Each of the challenges in the file are independent. The first one of medium difficulty called **Perfect Sampling Algorithm** consists of implementing a sampling algorithm to obtain probability distributions of MPS tensor networks, as well as the simulation of quantum states to check the proper functioning of the algorithm. The second challenge, a little more difficult, called **Canonical Truncation Algorithm**, consists of the implementation of a truncation algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of an MPS network.


To install the necessary python libraries run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the terminal.
