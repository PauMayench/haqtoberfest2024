# Qubit Mapping Challenge

This folder contains all necessary information about transpilation of qubit mapping in real quantum hardware. 

In the [notebooks](notebooks) folder you will find the files that contain the different parts of the challenge. Inside the folder you can find:

- [Tutorial](notebooks/Tutorial.ipynb): notebook containing explanations about basic concepts and examples about qubit mapping.

- [Challenge](notebooks/Challenge.ipynb): notebook containing the challenge to solve, with different parts. We tried to make it, harder as you advance, so try your best, but don't get frustrated if you don't finish everything..

To install the necessary python libraries run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the terminal, from the `qubit_mapping` directory.
